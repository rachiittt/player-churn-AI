🎮 Player Churn Prediction System (Milestone-1)

A machine learning based analytics application that predicts whether a player is likely to stop playing a game using historical gameplay and engagement data.
The system analyzes behavioral patterns, calculates churn probability, and provides interpretable insights through an interactive web interface.

📌 Problem Statement

Online games and digital platforms lose users over time. Identifying players at risk of leaving early helps companies improve engagement and retention strategies.
